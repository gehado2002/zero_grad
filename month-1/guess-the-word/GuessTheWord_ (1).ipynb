        "## Word Guessing Game Project\n",
        "\n",
        "### Description:\n",
        "Create a Python program that simulates a word guessing game with a limited number of trials.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives:\n",
        "- Randomly select a word from a list.\n",
        "- Display the word with guessed letters revealed and unguessed letters as dots.\n",
        "- Allow the user to guess one letter at a time.\n",
        "- Limit the number of incorrect guesses the user can make.\n",
        "- Notify the user if their guess is correct or incorrect.\n",
        "- End the game when the word is fully guessed or when the user runs out of trials.\n",
        "- Display a congratulatory message if the word is guessed correctly or a game over message if the trials are exhausted.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Features:\n",
        "- **Random Word Selection:**\n",
        "  - The program will randomly choose a word from a predefined list of words.\n",
        "- **Word Display:**\n",
        "  - The program will show the word with guessed letters revealed and the remaining letters as dots (e.g., \"p.y.h.n\").\n",
        "- **User Input:**\n",
        "  - The user will be prompted to enter a single letter in each attempt.\n",
        "- **Guess Validation:**\n",
        "  - The program will validate the user's input to ensure it is a single alphabetic character.\n",
        "  - If the user guesses a letter that has already been guessed, they will be notified and asked to try another letter.\n",
        "- **Tracking Trials:**\n",
        "  - The program will keep count of how many incorrect guesses the user has made.\n",
        "  - The game will end if the user reaches the maximum number of allowed incorrect guesses.\n",
        "- **Feedback:**\n",
        "  - The user will be informed if their guess is correct or incorrect.\n",
        "- **Game Completion:**\n",
        "  - The game continues until the user successfully guesses all the letters in the word or exhausts the allowed number of incorrect guesses.\n",
        "  - Once the word is fully guessed, the program will congratulate the user.\n",
        "  - If the user runs out of trials, the program will display a game over message with the correct word.\n",
